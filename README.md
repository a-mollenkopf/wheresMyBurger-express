# Features

This project furthered my knowledge of express and express.handlebars. It helped me grasp mySQL and how to create tables and add information into those tables. I was having a little bit of trouble getting the jawsdb url stuff to work as it was not adding my new inputs into the database. I also could not get the heroku app to deploy properly.
